# Main document: Learning about CODAP

It may seem silly (it _is_ silly!) to write about CODAP in R Markdown. The whole point of CODAP, in this context, is to be an alternative to R.

## an introduction to CODAP and motivation for why they should invest some time learning about it

Let's insert HTML
<<insertHTML:[testR.html]


```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::includeHTML("testR.html")
```

## an (interactive?) example that illustrates how useful it is for data science education

## an activity or next step that the reader could undertake

## pointers to some additional next steps
